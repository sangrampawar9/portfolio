The project deals with the development of a ‘Voice Controlled Home Automation’ System.
It involves the control of multiple household electrical devices such as lights, fans as well as other home appliances via voice commands.

The aim of this project is to provide a convenient way for users to control their home appliances with minimum physical effort.
This concept is especially useful for the disabled or infirm as it provides them a way to control their home appliances remotely through voice, thereby granting them greater independence and minimum efforts in their homes. It offers a comfortable environment for others.

    A unit will be held in the user’s hands, which will consist of a wireless RF transmitter. The user will give the voice command in the transmitter, and this command will be transmitted to the receiver end, which is stationary near the switch board in the house.
	The output of the receiver will be connected to the input of the Voice Recognition Module. This module will then decode the voice and give outputs accordingly, where we have to first store commands in the module and train it, it is all explained below.
	This decoded output of the voice recognition module will be given to the microcontroller and accordingly, the microcontroller will know which relays to be operated on, whether to be switched ON or OFF.
	Thus, we are able to control electrical devices using voice command.
